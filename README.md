This project was developed as part of the Logic Design course, featuring a fully functional digital **Clock**, **Stopwatch**, and **Date system** using digital logic principles.

## 🔧 Features

- 🕒 **Digital Clock**  
  - Displays hours, minutes, and seconds  
  - Supports 12/24-hour format handling

- ⏱️ **Stopwatch**  
  - Includes start, stop, and reset functionality  
  - Accurate timing with clean logic design

- 📅 **Date Display**  
  - Shows day, month, and year  
  - Includes logic for correct date incrementation

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Proteus Simulation Software**
- **Digital Logic Circuit Design**
- **Electronic Components & Breadboarding**
- **Timing and Counting Logic with Flip-Flops and Counters**

## 🖥️ Simulation & Hardware Implementation

The project was first designed and verified through simulation in Proteus.
